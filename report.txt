In total, there were 400 different temperatures recorded into the dataset. 
Doing a quick google search says that the average temperature of an adult body can range from 97 degrees to 99 degrees. 
The average of all data points in this set is 99.185. 
This is just above what is considered the healthy average. 
The average of group A is 102.401 degreed which is well into moderate fever temperatures. 
The average of group B is only 96.8798 degrees which is a safe body temperature.If anything over 99 degrees counts as a fever temperature, that means that anybody in group A has a fever.
Group A consists of 167 out of 400 total people in the dataset.
If these people were chosen randomly, then is is a crazy amount of people to have a fever.
Most likely, this means that this dataset is taken from people who are suspected of being sick.
That would explain why so many of them have fevers.
